				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>Uses COOL</p>
					<p>This skill allows the Rocker to sway crowds equal to his level squared times 200. This ability (added to your Cool stat) allows the Rockerboy to control, incite and charm large number of people through his or her performance skills. When under the Rocker's control, this group can easily be persuaded to act on his suggestions; for example, a Rocker could convince a concert crowd to riot in the streets or attack a heavilyfortified police line. Charismatic Leadership will only work with groups of ten or more people as it is primarily a mob leadership ability. The higher your Charismatic Leadership, the larger a crowd you can control and the more direct and complex the instructions you can get them to follow. For example, a Level +3 Leadership could incite a nightclub crowd to get rowdy. A Level +5 or +6 could provoke a concert crowd of thousands to trash a neighborhood, if the area wasn't too far from the hall. At Level +9, and higher, you have the same sort of mesmeric ability as an Adolph Hitler—you can raise armies, start movements, and destroy nations.</p>

					<p>Uses COOL</p>
					<p>The ability to intimidate or control others through your position as a lawman. This attribute represents the Cop's ability to call on the forces of the Law and Government to get what he wants. Cops can use Authority to question sus-pects, arrest wrongdoers, and defend in-nocents. Backed by the power of Authority, a cop can arrest, detain, confiscate and enter nearly anywhere, as long as he has the proper arrest or search warrants to back his play. However, authority is only as good as the guy holding the badge—if the cop appears uncertain of his Authority, there's a good chance he'll get nailed by the people he's trying to confront. The higher your Authority, the more able you are to face down criminals, particularly high level mobsters and officials. Authority is applied to your Cool stat. </p>

This is critical to getting your story heard and acted upon, as well as convincing people to tell you things, give you information, or get you into where the story is really happening. The higher your Credibility, the more people you can convince, and the easier it is to convince high level authorities of the truth of your information. With a level +3 Credibility, you can convince most people of minor scandals. With a level +5 or +6, you can convince local officials of military atrocities, undercover dealings and other front page stuff.

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>This skill covers any type of trained fighting style using hands, feet, or specialized "martial arts" weapons. You must elect a style of martial art and take a separate skill for each style (for example, you would have to take Karate and Judo separately, spending points for each one).</p>
					<p>The primary advantage to martial arts styles is that each one has what are called key attacks; attacks that reflect particular strengths of the style. When a key attack is used, there is a to-hit bonus based on the attack type and martial arts style. A full table of key attacks is listed in Friday Night Firelight, pg.100.</p>
					<p>The second advantage to martial arts styles is that there is a damage bonus on attacks equal to the level of the Martial Arts skill; for example, a master with a +10 Kung Fu Skill would add 10 points to his damage. This can be a formidable advantage, particularly in head strikes (which double damage).</p>
					<p>- Aikido (3): This form relies on using the opponent's strength and momentum against him. It is a perfect form for stopping an opponent peacefully while making yourself very hard to hit. Key attacks are: blocks &amp; parries, dodges, throws, holds, escapes, chokes, sweeps, trips &amp; sweeps, grapples.</p>
					<p>- Animal Kung Fu (3): These are forms based on animal movements, such as crane, mantis, tiger, leopard and dragon forms. These attacks are fast and dangerous, with a style that is exciting and flashy. Key attacks include: strikes, punches, kicks, blocks &amp; parries, sweeps &amp; trips.</p>
					<p>- Boxing (1): The manly art of fisticuffs, this form delivers lightning punches and a tightblocking defense. Key attacks are: punches, blocks &amp; parries.</p>
					<p>- Capoeria (3): Created by Carribean slaves, this form combines dancelike movements with fast kicks and low line sweeps. It is a relatively unknown form and can be combined with dance moves to disguise it's true power. Key attacks are: punches, kicks, blocks &amp; parries, dodges, and sweeps &amp; trips.</p>
					<p>- Choi Li Fut (3): Descended directly from the ancient Shaolin temples, this form combines powerful roundhouse blows and sweeping kicks into a dynamic fighting style. Key attacks are: strikes, punches, kicks, blocks &amp; parries, dodges, throws, and sweeps &amp; trips.</p>
					<p>- Judo(1): This system was designed as a sport form, but is very effective in combat as well. It uses throws and sweeps to knock down the opponent. Key attacks include: dodges, throws, holds, escapes, sweeps &amp; trips and grappling.</p>
					<p>- Karate (2): The Japanese version of kung fu, this style uses straight line movements and powerful blows. Variations include shotokan and kenpo, each with their own special moves. Key attacks are: punches, kicks, and blocks &amp; parries.</p>
					<p>- Tae Kwon Do (3): A very fast and precise form, with graceful movements and some aerial kicks. Key attacks include: strikes, punches, kicks, block &amp; parries, dodges.</p>
					<p>- Thai Kick Boxing (4): One of the deadliest forms in existence, this style is known for blinding kicks delivered with incredible power. Key moves include: strikes, punches, kicks, blocks &amp; parries, and grapples.</p>
					<p>- Wrestling (1): This form combines techniques of Olympic and Professonal wrestling. The style uses a wide variety of throws and holds to incapacitate the opponent. Key attacks include: throws, holds, escapes, chokes, sweeps, trips, and grapples.</p>
